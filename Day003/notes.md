### JWT Authentication Integration

- Integrated **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure login authentication in a Node.js application.
- Used **cookie-parser** to store and manage JWT tokens in cookies, allowing secure and persistent user sessions.
- Implemented **bcryptjs** for hashing passwords, enhancing security by protecting user credentials.
- Result: A secure, scalable, and well-structured login system.
